1.- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number
2.- Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names
3.- Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word print.

Python Keywords
Each of the following keywords has a specific meaning, and youâ€™ll see an error if you try to use any of them as a variable name.

	False      await      else       import     pass
	None       break      except     in         raise
	True       class      finally    is         return
	and        continue   for        lambda     try
	as         def        from       nonlocal   while
	assert     del        global     not        with
	async      elif       if         or         yield
4.- Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name
5.- Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0
